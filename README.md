# PomoTrackr

Welcome to **PomoTrackr**, a minimal pomodoro timer web application designed to enhance your productivity by keeping you focused. The app uses the popular Pomodoro Technique, breaking down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Set your timer to work for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break.
- **Theme Toggling**: Switch between light and dark mode to suit your preference or time of day.
- **Progress Tracking**: Gamify your productivity with a colored grid that fills up as you complete more pomodoro cycles.

## How It Works

1. **Set Your Timer**: Start the timer to begin your focus period.
2. **Work Hard**: Focus on your task until the timer rings.
3. **Take a Break**: Enjoy a well-deserved break after your session ends.
4. **Repeat**: Start your next session and watch your productivity grid fill up!
